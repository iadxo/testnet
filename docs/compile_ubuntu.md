Make sure that that you are running Ubuntu 16 or later:

(earlier versions of ubuntu requires manually installing the latest version of erlang, because the package manager installs an old version)

Use this command to check your version number
```
lsb_release -a
```

Make sure that your system is up-to-date:
```
sudo apt-get update
```
and
```
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

For Ubuntu, install following dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install erlang libncurses5-dev libssl-dev unixodbc-dev g++ git erlang-base-hipe
```

Next, download Aeternity Testnet. Optionally you can run next steps with a non-root user, for better security.

```
git clone https://github.com/aeternity/testnet.git
```
Now you can go into the directory, and compile the aeternity testnet.

```
cd testnet/
sh install.sh
```


Now you can run your node. with ```sh start.sh```
